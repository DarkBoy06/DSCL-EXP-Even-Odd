# DSCL-EXP-Even-Odd
Short Description: This C program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether it is odd or even using bitwise AND operation.

Algorithm:

Declare an integer variable x. Prompt the user to input the value of x. Read the value of x from the user using the scanf function. Check whether x is odd or even using the bitwise AND operation and the if-else statement. If x is odd, the bitwise AND operation of x and 1 will result in 1. In this case, print "Output is Odd" using the printf function. If x is even, the bitwise AND operation of x and 1 will result in 0. In this case, print "Output is Even" using the printf function.

Output: When this program is executed, it will prompt the user to input an integer value. After the user inputs the value, the program will check whether it is odd or even using bitwise AND operation and print the result. For example, if the user inputs 5, the program will output:

Output is Odd This is because 5 has the binary representation 101, and the bitwise AND of 5 and 1 is 1, indicating that 5 is odd. If the user inputs 4, the program will output:

Output is Even This is because 4 has the binary representation 100, and the bitwise AND of 4 and 1 is 0, indicating that 4 is even.
